# âš¡ .NET Benchmarking Guidelines

This directory contains rules for writing effective benchmarks and performance tests for .NET applications.

## ğŸ“Š [Benchmarking](benchmarking.mdc)

Use these rules when:
- ğŸ”¬ Writing micro-benchmarks with BenchmarkDotNet
- ğŸ“ˆ Measuring performance regressions
- ğŸ§® Analyzing memory allocations
- ğŸ’ª Testing hardware-specific optimizations
- ğŸ”„ Setting up performance testing in CI/CD

These rules ensure:
- âœ… Accurate and reproducible benchmarks
- ğŸ”’ Proper benchmark isolation
- ğŸ“Š Memory and GC analysis
- âš¡ Hardware intrinsics optimization
- ğŸ“ˆ Performance regression tracking
- ğŸš€ CI/CD integration for benchmarks
