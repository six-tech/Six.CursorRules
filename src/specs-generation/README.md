# 📋 Specification-Driven Development

This directory contains rules for implementing structured specification-driven development practices that bridge the gap between requirements and implementation through comprehensive documentation.

## 🎯 [Code by Specifications](coding-by-spec.mdc)

Use these rules when:
- 📝 Creating detailed project specifications before coding
- 🏗️ Bridging the gap between product requirements and technical implementation
- 👥 Collaborating with product managers, designers, and developers
- 📚 Maintaining living documentation that evolves with the project
- 🧪 Ensuring testable requirements and acceptance criteria
- 🔄 Managing iterative development with specification refinement

These rules ensure:
- 📋 **Structured requirements** using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements' Syntax)
- 🏗️ **Technical architecture** documentation with design decisions
- ✅ **Detailed implementation plans** with trackable tasks and dependencies
- 🔄 **Iterative refinement** capabilities for evolving specifications
- 📊 **Clear acceptance criteria** that translate directly to test cases
- 👥 **Cross-team collaboration** between product and engineering teams
- 📈 **Quality assurance** through specification reviews and validation
- 🔗 **Traceability** from requirements through design to implementation
- 📖 **Living documentation** that stays current with project changes
