# Six Cursor Rules

A comprehensive collection of Cursor AI assistant rules designed to enhance software development quality, consistency,
and productivity across multiple technology stacks. This project provides structured guidelines covering:

- **Technical documentation** - Standards for writing and maintaining project documentation
- **.NET ecosystem** - ASP.NET, Avalonia, Blazor, CI/CD, and related technologies
- **C# development** - Language-specific coding standards and best practices
- **Web technologies** - Astro, TypeScript, and modern web development frameworks
- **Specification-driven development** - Structured approaches to requirements and implementation
- **General software engineering practices** - Coding standards, testing, benchmarking, dependency management, and package publishing

## What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules are configuration files (`.mdc` format) that guide AI assistants in Cursor IDE to follow specific
development practices, coding standards, and workflow patterns. These rules ensure consistent code quality, proper
documentation, and adherence to industry best practices across different domains and technologies.

## Installation

To use these Cursor Rules in your project:

1. **Copy the rules** - Copy the desired `.mdc` rule files from this repository to your project's `.cursor/rules/`
   directory
2. **Create the directory** - If the `.cursor/rules/` directory doesn't exist, create it in your solution root
3. **Restart Cursor** - Restart Cursor IDE to ensure the new rules are loaded
4. **Verify activation** - The AI assistant will automatically apply these rules when working in your project

**Directory Structure:**

## Writing New Rules Using .meta.mdc

### What is `.meta.mdc`?

`.meta.mdc` represents the **meta-framework** and **standardized structure** used to create consistent, high-quality Cursor rules across the Six Cursor Rules collection. 

It's not a single file, but rather a **methodology and template** that ensures all rules follow the same proven structure for optimal AI assistant guidance.

### Why Use the `.meta.mdc` Approach?

The `.meta.mdc` methodology provides several key benefits:

- **üîÑ Consistency**: All rules follow the same structure, making them predictable and easy to understand
- **üéØ Clarity**: Clear role definitions and requirements help AI assistants understand their scope
- **üìù Documentation**: Standardized format ensures comprehensive coverage of topics
- **üîß Maintainability**: Common structure makes rules easier to update and maintain
- **üé® Best Practices**: Incorporates proven patterns for effective AI-assisted development

### How to Write New Rules Using `.meta.mdc`

#### 1. **Front Matter Structure**
Every rule starts with standardized front matter:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what this rule covers
globs: file-patterns-where-rule-applies.md,*.cs,*.ts
alwaysApply: false  # Set to true for universal rules
---
```

#### 2. **Title Format**
Use the standardized title format:
```markdown
# Cursor Rules File: [Descriptive Rule Name]
```

#### 3. **Role Definition Section**
Define the AI assistant's roles and expertise areas:

```markdown
**Role Definition:**
- Primary Expert Role
- Secondary Expert Role
- Specialized Skill Area
```

#### 4. **General Section Structure**
Include these essential subsections:

```markdown
## General

### Description
Clear explanation of the rule's purpose and scope.

### Requirements
- **NEVER**: Critical restrictions (e.g., security, sensitive data)
- Specific technical requirements
- Best practices to follow
- Tools or frameworks to use
```

#### 5. **Domain-Specific Sections**
Organize content into logical sections based on the domain:

```markdown
## [Domain Area 1]
Content specific to the first major area...

## [Domain Area 2]
Content for the second major area...

### [Subsection]
Detailed guidance within a domain area...
```

#### 6. **DO/DON'T Patterns**
Use clear success/failure patterns:

```markdown
### ‚úÖ DO: Recommended Approach
```code
// Good example
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Avoid This Pattern
```code
// Bad example to avoid
```
```

#### 7. **File Organization**
Place new rules in appropriate directories:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dotnet/           # .NET ecosystem rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web/             # Web technologies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specs-generation/# Specification rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation/   # Documentation standards
```

### Best Practices for Rule Creation

#### **Content Guidelines**
- **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples and actionable guidance
- **Include Context**: Explain why practices matter, not just what to do
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with basics, then advanced concepts
- **Cross-References**: Link to related rules when relevant

#### **Technical Requirements**
- **File Extensions**: Use `.mdc` for Cursor rule files
- **Glob Patterns**: Define specific file patterns for rule activation
- **Security First**: Include security considerations in requirements
- **Testing Focus**: Emphasize testing and validation practices

#### **Documentation Standards**
- **Clear Descriptions**: Front matter descriptions should be concise but informative
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Address common scenarios and edge cases
- **Regular Updates**: Keep rules current with evolving best practices

### Example Rule Template

```markdown
---
description: Guidelines for [specific technology/practice]
globs: *.extension, path/patterns/**
alwaysApply: false
---

# Cursor Rules File: [Technology/Practice] Best Practices

**Role Definition:**
- Primary Technology Expert
- Best Practices Specialist
- Implementation Guide

## General

### Description
Brief overview of what this rule covers and why it matters.

### Requirements
- **NEVER**: Critical restrictions
- Key technical requirements
- Best practices to follow

## [Main Topic Area]
Detailed guidance for the primary focus area...

## [Secondary Topic Area]
Additional guidance for related concepts...

## Special Thanks
```

### Rule Validation Checklist

Before finalizing a new rule, ensure it includes:

- [ ] Clear, descriptive front matter
- [ ] Well-defined role definitions
