# Six Cursor Rules

A comprehensive collection of Cursor AI assistant rules designed to enhance software development quality, consistency, and productivity. This project provides structured guidelines for various aspects of software development including coding standards, specification writing, package publishing, and tool management.

## What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules are configuration files (`.mdc` format) that guide AI assistants in Cursor IDE to follow specific development practices, coding standards, and workflow patterns. These rules ensure consistent code quality, proper documentation, and adherence to industry best practices across different domains and technologies.

## Available Rules

### üìã [Coding by Specification](.cursor/rules/coding-by-spec.mdc)

**Purpose**: Establishes a structured specification-driven development workflow that generates detailed spec files and ensures code implementation adheres to those specifications.
This is **similar approach as Amazon's Kiro** does but manually with Cursor.

**Generated Files Structure**:
```
.cursor/specs/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {feature-name}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md
```

#### üìù requirements.md - User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

**Purpose**: Captures functional requirements using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements' Syntax) notation for clear, testable specifications.

**Content Structure**:
- User stories written in structured EARS format
- Each requirement in code blocks with specific WHEN/THEN syntax
- Acceptance criteria that can be directly translated to test cases
- Business rules and validation requirements

**Example Content**:
```markdown
# User Authentication Requirements

## Primary User Stories

```
WHEN a user provides valid credentials
THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate the user and provide access to the application
```

```
WHEN a user provides invalid credentials
THE SYSTEM SHALL display an error message and deny access
```

```
WHEN a user attempts to access a protected resource without authentication
THE SYSTEM SHALL redirect to the login page
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Login form validates email format
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- System supports "Remember Me" functionality
- Failed login attempts are logged for security
```

#### üèóÔ∏è design.md - Technical Architecture & Design Decisions

**Purpose**: Documents the technical architecture, component interactions, and implementation considerations for the feature.

## üîÑ How to Use Generated Specs for Code Implementation

### Step 1: Spec Generation
```
"Create a spec for user authentication feature"
```
Cursor will generate the three files in `.cursor/specs/user-authentication/`

### Step 2: Requirements Review
- Review `requirements.md` to understand business needs
- Validate acceptance criteria are complete and testable
- Identify any missing requirements

### Step 3: Design Review
- Review `design.md` for technical architecture
- Understand component interactions and data flow
- Verify technology choices align with project standards

### Step 4: Task-Driven Implementation
- Start with Phase 1 tasks from `tasks.md`
- Mark tasks as "In Progress" when starting work
- Update status to "Completed" with checkmark when done
- Use task descriptions as implementation guides

### Step 5: Cursor-Assisted Coding
When implementing, Cursor will:
- Reference the spec files for context
- Generate code that matches the documented architecture
- Ensure implementation aligns with requirements
- Create tests based on acceptance criteria

### Step 6: Iterative Refinement
- Update specs as implementation reveals new requirements
- Add new tasks for discovered work
- Refine design based on implementation learnings

**Example Cursor Commands**:
```
"Implement the login endpoint according to the authentication spec"
"Create unit tests for the password hashing service as defined in tasks.md"
"Generate the User model based on the design.md specifications"
```

This workflow ensures systematic, specification-driven development with clear traceability from requirements to implementation.
