# Cursor Rules

This document outlines the meta-rules for cursor operations in this repository.

## Line Ending & Formatting Rules

1. **Line Endings**
   - Don't modify existing line endings
   - Preserve CRLF/LF as found in the original file

2. **Whitespace**
   - Preserve trailing whitespace where it exists
   - Maintain existing indentation style (spaces vs tabs)
   - Keep line length consistent with existing code

## File Handling

1. **MDC Files**
   - Always commit changes to `*.mdc` files directly
   - Ensure changes to `*.mdc` files are synchronized with their implementation
   - Maintain consistent formatting within MDC files
   - Prefer modifying existing files over creating new ones unless explicitly requested
   - When adding new content, first check if it fits within an existing rule file


2. **File Creation**

   - Only create new rule files when:
     - Explicitly requested by the user
     - The content doesn't logically fit in any existing rule file
     - Creating a new file would significantly improve organization and clarity
   - Document the rationale for creating new files in their README.md

## Code Style & Structure

1. **Formatting**
   - Preserve existing code formatting patterns
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions
   - Keep indentation consistent with the file style

2. **Organization**
   - Keep the file structure consistent
   - Don't move files without updating all references
   - Maintain the existing import /include order

## Rule Content

1. **Examples**
    - Always include "do" and "don't" examples when showing specific changes to files or syntax
    - Include helpful comments that explain why an example is a "do" or a "don't"
